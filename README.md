## 🧠 ML Pipeline Details

### Data Pipeline
- **Data Sources**: Curated business name datasets and synthetic data generation
- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vocabulary building
- **Augmentation**: Template-based synthetic name generation for training diversity

### Model Architecture
- **Type**: Transformer Encoder-Decoder
- **Input**: Industry + Theme (e.g., "technology software")
- **Output**: Creative business name (e.g., "TechFlow Solutions")
- **Features**: 
  - Positional encoding for sequence understanding
  - Attention mechanisms for context awareness
  - Dropout for regularization
  - Early stopping for optimal training

### Training Process
1. **Data Collection**: Gather business names from multiple sources
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize text data
3. **Vocabulary Building**: Create word-to-index mappings
4. **Model Training**: Train transformer with supervised learning
5. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance on validation set
6. **Model Saving**: Persist best model checkpoints
